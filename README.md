The ethical implications of using generative AI for government lobbying or political influence, as described in the article, can be analyzed through three primary ethical frameworks: utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics. Each framework we were given offers a unique lens through which to evaluate the ethics of employing AI in such a context. Utilitarianism, a consequentialist theory, suggests that the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes, with the most ethical action being the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility. From a utilitarian perspective, using AI in lobbying could be seen as ethical if it leads to greater overall benefits for society, such as more efficient communication between constituents and their representatives or enabling underrepresented groups to have their voices heard. However, the potential for misuse, such as the amplification of powerful interests over the general public or the manipulation of democratic processes, could result in significant harm. The ethicality under utilitarianism would hinge on whether the benefits of using AI for lobbying outweigh the potential harms to democratic integrity and public trust. This is a big point in the argument for Utilitariansim, miuse to manipulate democratic process is what everyone fears will happen if AI is used for lobbying. Deontological ethics focuses on the morality of actions based on rules, duties, or inherent rights, regardless of the outcomes. From this perspective, using AI for lobbying could be considered unethical if it violates principles of fairness, transparency, and respect for individuals' autonomy. Deontology would critique the manipulation influence on democratic processes, suggesting that even if the outcomes are positive, the means of achieving them (through potential deception or exploitation) are inherently wrong. The principle of informed consent and the right to a transparent democratic process are paramount, and any action that undermines these principles could be deemed unethical. Virtue ethics emphasizes the importance of moral character and the virtues that constitute a good life, rather than specific actions or consequences. Under virtue ethics, the use of AI in lobbying would be evaluated based on the virtues or vices it promotes within individuals and society. For example, employing AI in a way that fosters honesty, equity, and civic engagement could be viewed positively. On the otherhand, if its use encourages deceit, manipulation, or exacerbates inequality, it would be considered unethical. Considering these frameworks together, the ethical use of AI in government lobbying and political influence appears to be highly context-dependent, requiring a careful relationships between the potential benefits and risks.
